"""
This file provides the basic functions to perform asynchronous tasks.
It provides the 3 functions:
 * ensure_future(coroutine): schedules the task described by the coroutine and
                             returns a Future that can be used as argument of
                             the following functions:
 * sleep(time_s): blocks the commandline for time_s, without blocking other
                  tasks such as gui update...
 * wait(future, timeout=None): blocks the commandline until future is set or
                               timeout expires.

BEWARE: sleep() and wait() can be used behind a qt slot (for instance in
response to a QPushButton being pressed), however, they will fail if used
inside a coroutine. In this case, one should use the builtin await (in
place of wait) and the asynchronous sleep coroutine provided below (in
place of sleep):
  * async_sleep(time_s): await this coroutine to stall the execution for a
                         time time_s within a coroutine.

These functions are provided in place of the native asyncio functions in
order to integrate properly within the IPython (Jupyter) Kernel. For this,
Main loop of the application:
In an Ipython (Jupyter) notebook with qt integration:
    %gui qt
     fut = ensure_future(some_coroutine(), loop=LOOP) # executes anyway in
the background loop
#    LOOP.run_until_complete(fut) # only returns when fut is ready
# BEWARE ! inside some_coroutine, calls to asyncio.sleep_async() have to be
# made this way:
#    asyncio.sleep(sleep_time, loop=LOOP)
# Consequently, there is a coroutine async_utils.async_sleep(time_s)
# Finally this file provides a sleep() function that waits for the execution of
# sleep_async and that should be used in place of time.sleep.
